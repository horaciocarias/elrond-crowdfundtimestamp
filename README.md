# elrond-crowdfundtimestamp
Basic Elrond crowdfunding contract with deadline based on block timestamp rather than block nonce

This is based on the crowdfunding-egld contract provided as a template within [Elrond IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elrond.vscode-elrond-ide) 

All default mandos have been modified to use block timestamp as well.
